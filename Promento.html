            <strong>Welcome to Promento, your programming mentor and your gate to excel programming in various fields. </strong> <br>
            Many of us want to learn programming but donâ€™t know where to start or what to learn as:
            <ul>
                <li>Most programming courses are very expensive.</li>
                <li>Online courses donâ€™t give you that ability to interact with mentors or other students to learn from them.</li>
            </ul>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;We will help you know more about differnt programming fields, learn them and provide you with online resources and competitions to improve your skills. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim is to help students easily learn about different fields of programming like: Web development, Python and many others by offering them:
            <ul>
                <li> Full free courses with exercises, quizzes, and projects. </li>
                <li> Mentorship to fully understand the concepts. </li>
                <li> A programming community, so they can interact with others who share the same passion, help each other, or maybe make teams to join competitions.</li>
                <li> Provide them with online sources and competitions to enable them to continue self-learning in the field they like and improve their skills. </li>
            </ul>
